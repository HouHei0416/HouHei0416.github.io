# Volunteering
I am passionate about volunteering. In August 2023, I joined the Tanzania International Volunteer Project, where I conducted teaching programs at six primary and secondary schools across Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. It was a meaningful and eye-opening cultural experience.

# Macao
I come from Macao, a place I deeply love.
In 2024, I served as the President of the Tsinghua University Macao Cultural Association and co-founded a three-day [Macao Food Festival](https://www.macaodaily.com/html/2024-10/24/content_1789647.htm) in the university cafeteria. We invited 11 master chefs from Macao, and the event attracted over 20,000 attendees. Some participants even queued for more than three hours.
Thanks to its popularity, Macanese cuisine has now become a permanent option at Tsinghua. There is a special food window on the third floor of Zijingyuan Canteen. Please give it a try if you visit Tsinghua.

# Taekwondo
I have loved Taekwondo since the 6th grade.
In my second year at Tsinghua, I became Captain of the Tsinghua University Taekwondo Team. I now serve as President of the Tsinghua University Student Taekwondo Association. Taekwondo has shaped my discipline, confidence, and leadership.

# Scientific Interest
My passion for science began at a young age. I was honored to be supported by the Macao Government to conduct [scientific research in Antarctica](https://www.fdct.gov.mo/en/Antarctic.html) during my teenage years. After returning to Macao, I developed a Self-Adaptive Inspection System for Polar Research. This project won a [Grand Award at the Regeneron ISEF](https://isef.net/project/robo008t---self-adaptive-inspection-system-for-polar-research), the world’s most prestigious pre-college STEM competition and a well-known cradle of future Nobel laureates.

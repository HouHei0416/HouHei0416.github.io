<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


My name is Hou Hei Lam (Henry) and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Automation at Tsinghua University. I am also a member of [Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/author/houhei-lam/), a research talent program founded by Prof. [Song-Chun Zhu](https://zhusongchun.net/), dedicated to cultivating future leaders in AI and cognitive science.

My long-term goal is to build an AI Scientist with human-like cognitive abilities, one that can truly expand the frontiers of scientific discovery. With this mission in mind, from my first to third year as an undergraduate I immersed myself in a variety of AI4Science projects to understand how far the current methodologies can really take us in practice. These projects convinced me that, while powerful, today’s approaches alone are unlikely to realize truly intelligent scientific discovery.

Now, I return to the fundamental question that has always been at the heart of my curiosity: **what are the core ingredients and the recipe behind human intelligence?** I believe that understanding this will be crucial for developing the next generation of intelligent systems that can reason, explore, and create knowledge like human scientists.
